***** Maze Game *****
=====================

Controls:
b : to initiate a breadth first search on the maze
c : to change the mode to make a maze with no bias towards a direction
d : to initiate a depth first search on the maze
h : to change the mode to make a maze with a horizontal bias
v : to change the mode to make a maze with a vertical bias
k : to toggle the knocking down of the walls
n : to reset the game
p : to toggle the viewing of the path
t : to display the minimum spanning tree

up : moves the player up one space
left : moves the player left one space
right : moves the player right one space
down : moves the player down one space

How to Play:
1. Control the player using the up, left, right and down keys on the keyboard.
2. The player will start in the top left-hand corner of the screen.
3. To win, control the character and navigate them through the maze to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. A message will display once the player has won the game.
4. To reset the game, press “n”.
5. To display the minimal spanning tree of the maze, press “t”.
6. To reset the game and play a maze with a vertical bias, press “h”. The regular reset key “n” creates mazes with horizontal bias.
7. To select the bias in which the maze is built, press “c” for classic mode, or no bias, “h” for a horizontal bias, or “v” for a vertical bias.
7. To change the size and dimensions of the maze, change the MAZE_HEIGHT and MAZE_WIDTH of the game.
8. To view a larger maze size, please lower the "SCALE" variable of the game in order to fit everything.

Whistles:
1- Provide an option to toggle the viewing of the minimal spanning tree (press “t”)
2- Provide an option to toggle the viewing of the visited paths (press “p”)
3- Allow the user the ability to start a new maze without restarting the program (press “n”)
4- Displays the amount of wrong moves the player does.

Bell:
1- In addition to animating the solution of the maze, also animate the construction of the maze: on each tick, show a single wall being knocked down. (press “k” to toggle)
2- Construct mazes with a bias in a particular direction - a preference for horizontal or vertical corridors. (press “h” “v” or “c”)

Notes:
- The maximum size of the maze that the game can be played at is 100 x 60.
- Depending on how large the dimensions of the maze are, the game might run slightly slower, which is variable depending on what computer the game is being run on.
- Depending on how large the dimensions of the maze are, the tests might encounter a memory error, since many of the method tests utilize for and for each loops on each element of an ArrayList.
- The wrong moves count is done by counting how many times the player back tracked, not how many vertices are not in the solution path
